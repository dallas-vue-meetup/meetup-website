### Description

<p>We will be hosting our first meetup at Dialexa on Tuesday, July 24th from 6pm to 8pm. Food and drink will be provided! We will have two short talks about Vue. The first- Adding Vue to an Existing Project Without a Build Pipeline. And the second, a Deep Dive Into Vueâ€™s Built In Directives. After the talks we will be happy to help answer any Vue questions, or you're welcome to just hang out and hack.</p>
