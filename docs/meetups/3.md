### Description

<p>Hey everyone! I know it's been a while since we all met, so for this next month's meetup we're going to keep it simple with a workshop, followed by time for people to work on their own projects where we'll be available to answer questions. We will resume our usual meetup format of multiple talks and speakers in the new year.</p> <p>Joe and I were lucky enough to attend VueConf in Toronto, so we will also be giving you guys a quick event recap and an overview of the major topics (Vue 3.0!). After this, we will be going through a workshop where we will be using slots. If you already feel confident with slots, we would still love to have you join us to work on your own projects and discuss anything in the JS world!</p> <p>The agenda for this meetup will be:</p> <p>Snacks &amp; Drinks: 6:30-7:00pm<br/>VueConf Recap: 7:00-7:15pm<br/>Slots Workshop: 7:15-8:00pm<br/>Networking and Hacking: 8:00-8:30pm</p> <p>Feel free to message me if you have any questions - we look forward to seeing you there!<br/>--<br/>Tim</p>
